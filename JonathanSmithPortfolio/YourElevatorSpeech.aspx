                My name is Jonathan Smith. I'm currently working at Infusionsoft as the highest tier of support. I learn quickly and adapt to new situations. In my last job I went from not knowing the programming language for the job to being the lead programmer in charge of helping other programmers in 6 months. Where do you see me in your company?

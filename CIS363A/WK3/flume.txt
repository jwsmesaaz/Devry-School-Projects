Flume Trail

The Famous Flume trail is aurguably one of the world's finest mountain bike rides. Starting at Spooner Summit, this ride climbs through aspen forests and meadows up to Martlette Lake. The crags and peaks of the Carson Range rise up to the East while you wind your way aound the lake shore. Eventually you come to the dam that was at the head of a 19th century logging flume designed to transport lumber to the ravenous mines of Virginia City and the Comstock Lode. From this point you follow the path of the long-gone flume as it hugs the cliff 2000 feet above Lake Tahoe. This stretch has some of the most spectacular views of any trail in the world. Eventually as the flume trail ends, you can follow a trail for a 1000 ft descent back to the highway and your shuttle.

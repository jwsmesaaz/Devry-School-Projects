Keystone Canyon

The Keystone Canyon is a ride that can be changed up to vary greatly. The basic ride described here starts in Keystone Canyon and turns around just prior to the start of the climb up Peavine Mountain. You can do a number of loops up the mountain or back around to San Rafael Park. 

The ride starts at the Keystone Canyon trailhead and works its way through the canyon. There are a few washouts and abandoned cars in the trail, so keep you wits about you. This is also a popular trail for joggers and people with their dogs off leash, so caution is advised. 

After working your way through the canyon, you will pass a set of radio towers. The trail breaks off of the road just beyond the towers. You can continue your ride past this point adding as much distance as you require for you ride. Once you are completed, you will turn around and enjoy a nice downhill ride back to your car.

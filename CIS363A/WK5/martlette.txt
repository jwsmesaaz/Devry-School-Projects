Martlette Lake

The Martlette Lake ride begins at Spooner Lake and climbs the same trail as you would take for the Flume Trail. The trail to Martlette Lake begins in the Spooner Lake parking lot and follows the North Canyon trail, a well maintained dirt road used by hikers and mountain bikers alike. Recently a new hiking trail was completed lowering the number of hikers on the trial. 

A large meadow of wildflowers is located at the beginning of the trail, with Aspen groves in ample view as you head further north. The Aspen are particularly beautiful in October when the golden leaves reach full color. The highlight of the Ride is beauty of Martlette Lake. A great spot for lunch before heading back. 

Other hikes are available in the area, but are mostly off limits to bikes. If you are willing to leave your bike behind. The Tahoe Rim Trail has a section leaving Spooner Summit and making a great loop trail including a stop at the lake.

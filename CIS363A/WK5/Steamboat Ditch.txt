Steamboat Ditch

The Steamboat ditch trail follows along the bank of the Steamboat ditch, one of the earliest irrigation canals in the Reno area. In total the ditch is a 21 mile long trail. Only parts of the trail welcome riders, the primary part of which is on the Western side of town in the Caughlin Ranch subdivision. 

Because the trail follows the ditch it is a very flat ride and an easy place for beginners to get their feel for their bike off-road. If you want to add a little challenge to the ride, you can start the ride from Mayberry Park in West Reno and add a mile climb up the Tom Cooke trail. 

To start this ride you need to find your way to Woodchuck road in the Caughlin Ranch subdivision. Once there you will see the ditch crossing under the road. Park at the trailhead and begin your ride past the luxury homes in the area. Soon you will leave the housing complex and pass Hunter Creek, which tumbles out of the mountains down to the Truckee River. As you work your way along the hillside you will find great views of the Truckee 500 ft. below you as well as Reno and Peavine Mountain. Eventually you will come to Hole-in-the-wall, a tunnel cut for the ditch through the mountain. This makes a good turn around for you ride back to your car.
